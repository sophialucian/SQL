-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- I determined the avg danceability, loudness and liveness by artist and track
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(danceability),
AVG(loudness),
AVG(liveness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

--I determined the top 10 artists based on popularity
SELECT 
artist_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--I determined the average energy level of the top 10 songs
SELECT
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 10;

--I determined what artist released the longest song
SELECT 
artist_name,
track_name,
duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

--I determined how many songs had a tempo greater than 100
SELECT
COUNT(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo > 100;

--I determined which of the top 15 songs had a liveness greater than .2
SELECT
track_name,
liveness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE liveness > .2 AND id < 15;

--I determined how many songs Olivia Rodrigo had on the chart
SELECT
COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = "Olivia Rodrigo";
